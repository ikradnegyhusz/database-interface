# Database Interface
## Abstract
The project contains a webserver, a user login system, and an interface for users to view/edit the contents of a database based on their rights.
It's a good starting point for any kind of online data management software.

## Usage
First thing you need to do is run main.py to start the server, and create an empty database file.
To test out how the program works I've made some helper scripts "base.py", "add.py", and the one that actually has to be used "add_menu.py".
With "add_menu.py" you can create an admin account which is useful for testing since it has all read and write rights. You can also add classes, users, etc.

## Issues
- The program was created for a specific project so parts of it is not in english.
- Some bugs are still present until I can access the newest version.
